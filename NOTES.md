## Pros
* Very lightweight, fast
* Code is extremely clean, I really like it!

## Cons
* Files are not written out as they finish downloading. Large torrents cannot
be resumed if the client exits
* Couldn't download test.torrent or Alice in Wonderland, while other clients
had no issue in doing so. Error:
    global name 'tracker' is not defined
    Unable to connect to a tracker for test.torrent
